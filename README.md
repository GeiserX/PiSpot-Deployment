# PiSpot Deployment

[![pispot-deployment compliant](https://img.shields.io/github/license/GeiserX/PiSpot-Deployment)](https://github.com/GeiserX/PiSpot-Deployment/blob/main/LICENSE)

Deployment software for the PiSpot suite: PiSpot Watch and PiSpot Show, both provide Wi-Fi voucher codes in Hotels. Developed and deployed in 2018 for the company GPConnect. I have decided to release the project as open-source due to the client's inability to proceed with payment.
